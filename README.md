# esp32camX
This is my adaption of the default ESP32 Cam Webserver with the LED Flash while streaming for monitoring my 3D printer in the dark.

# ATTENTION

While the camera image is being streamed via the URL "/stream", the LED for the flash is activated. This makes the module very warm and can damage it. This adaptation is NOT suitable for continuous operation!
